    <h1>2D PLATFORMER PROJECT</h1>

    <!-- First paragraph -->
    <p>
        Welcome to my 2D Platformer Project! This is an exciting game development journey where I explore platformer mechanics, level design, and character controls.
    </p>

    <!-- Second paragraph -->
    <p>
        The research phase was crucial in understanding how to create engaging levels that are both challenging and fun. I analyzed several successful platformers to gather insights on what makes a great game.
    </p>

    <!-- Third paragraph -->
    <p>
        During the planning stage, I designed different levels and challenges, keeping in mind user experience and gameplay flow. The final product is the result of numerous iterations and testing.

        <h3>Quantitive and Qualitive Research</h3>
        <p>There is numerous ways of research tools and techniques that can be used for creation of video games. You have your primary research which includes data collection from different sources you and A game developer may conducting playtests to observe how players interact with a new game mechanic and how it is performing. The feedback and data gathered will help improve the game before its release, which will help you improve. You have secondary research, which includes being collected by someone else in witch will provide information and finding out information from conducting surveys as such, Qualitative research is where you will look at it as a non-numerical data point of view were you will analyze it through non-numerical data, Quantitative Research, is where you look at it as a numerical data point of view  Quantitative research is also mostly used to standardize data collection and generalizing better informative findings.</p>

        <h3>Where Can This Be Used In Making 2D Games </h3>
        <p> Researching games is essential for making successful 2D games because it helps developers understand what works and what doesnt in game design. By studying popular and well made 2D games, you can gain insights into gameplay mechanics, storytelling, art styles, and player engagement strategies. These insights are crucial in creating a game that not only functions well but also captures the interest of players. 

  

One major benefit of researching games is learning how to structure gameplay mechanics. Many successful 2D games, like Celeste or Hollow Knight, have perfected their control systems, making sure that the players actions feel smooth and responsive. Understanding how these mechanics are implemented can guide developers in designing fluid controls that enhance the players experience. Additionally, research helps identify common pitfalls, such as frustrating difficulty spikes or confusing user interfaces, so developers can avoid them in their own games. 

  

Researching other games also provides inspiration for art direction and level design. Whether its the pixel art of classic platformers or the hand drawn aesthetics of modern indie games, looking at a variety of styles can spark creativity and help you decide on a visual approach that suits your game. You can also analyze how different games use visual storytelling to create immersive worlds without relying heavily on dialogue or text. 

  

Lastly, player feedback from existing games offers valuable lessons. By reading reviews and forums, developers can understand what players love or dislike in certain games. This knowledge can help you anticipate player expectations and design features that resonate with your target audience. 

  

In conclusion, researching games is a critical part of developing 2D games because it equips you with knowledge about what makes a game enjoyable, visually appealing, and engaging for players. This also allows you to know what audio fits what genre of game that you are making.

        <h3>Why Is First And Secondary Research Needed </h3>
        <p> When creating a 2D game, its important to gather information, you can do this through primary and secondary research. Primary research is when you collect information yourself. For example, if you want to know what players like in a game, you can ask them directly. You can also create a survey or interview players to learn about their favorite games, characters, or features. Another way you can do primary research is by watching people while they play games made by other companies. You should watch how they interact with the game, how and what makes them excited, or what frustrates them. You can even make a simple version of your game and invite your friends to play your game. By watching them play, you can see what they enjoy or find difficult. This feedback is valuable because it comes directly from the people who play and test your game. 

  

On the other hand, secondary research involves using information that someone else has already made. This can be articles, books, websites, or videos about game design and player preferences. For example, you can read articles about popular 2D games to understand how and what makes them successful. You could also watch YouTube videos that teach you about game development or read reviews of other games to see what players liked or didnt like. Secondary research is usually quicker than primary research because you dont have to collect the data yourself. 

  

Both primary and secondary research are important for creating a successful 2D game. Primary research gives you fresh ideas and direct feedback from players, while secondary research helps you learn from the experiences of others. By combining both types of research you can create a 2d game that people will enjoy and will keep playing and share with their friends.

        <h3>Case Study Research </h3>
        <p>Celeste and Hollow Knight are both really cool games, but they are pretty different from each other. In both games, you have to jump around and avoid things, but how you play them isnt the same. 

  

In Celeste, you play as a girl named Madeline. She is trying to climb a big mountain called Celeste Mountain. But the aim isnt just about climbing. Shes also trying to face her fears and feelings while going up the mountain. Sometimes she gets scared, but she keeps trying. In Hollow Knight, you play as a small warrior called the Knight. The Knight doesnt talk, and you dont know anything about him. He is exploring a huge underground kingdom called Hollownest, which is very spooky and full of bugs. The Knight must fight enemies while learning what happened to the kingdom. 

  

The way you play is really different. In Celeste, you have to jump, climb walls, and dash through tricky levels. The game can be tricky, but you can try again quickly if you mess up. There isnt enemies to fight; its all about making hard jumps. But in Hollow Knight, you have to explore a big, connected world. The Knight gets new powers as you play, and you can go back to places youve been to find new areas. There are loads of enemies to fight, and you even have to battle big bosses. The Knight uses a sword called a nail to fight, so the game is about fighting and exploring. 

  

The way the games look is also different. Celeste has pixel art, so it looks like more 2d with little squares that make up the characters and the world. Each part of the mountain is different, like some places are snowy and others are caves. Hollow Knight has hand drawn graphics, so it is really detailed. The world is dark and set in caves and old cities. The characters and enemies look like bugs, and the whole place feels spooky. 

  

The stories are different, too. In Celeste, the story is about Madeline trying to climb the mountain and face her own problems. Its a very personal story about her feelings. But in Hollow Knight, the story is more about the kingdom of Hallow nest. As the Knight, you explore the kingdom and figure out what happened to it. You have to discover the story by exploring and talking to other characters. 

  

Both games are fun and have you jumping around, theyre not the same. Celeste is all about climbing and facing your fears, while Hollow Knight is more about exploring, fighting, and finding out what happened to a lost kingdom. Both are great platformers, but they offer very different. 

  

In my opinion i think they are both great games and are both really enjoyable to play they arent to tricky or too easy and both have an amazing story line within the game too and they both use two different art styles which makes them both stand out from other games and have their own feel and twist to 2d platformers.

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>This section is all about me i will describe what got me into game development and the experience that I have gained during my time working and making games. I have been making games for around 2 and a half years now. My Journey started as a unity game developer making some pretty basic and not very good games for my first 2 years of experience and for about 2 months i learnt how to code my own game engine as well as make websites. For the last few months I have made the switch to unreal engine 5 and started working on my new game. 

The Reason I started game development was because I have always enjoyed makings things and playing games since I was very little so it just seemed write so I started learning how to create games after I started seeing people on Youtube like Brackeys making videos on how to create games. That is where my story began and how I got to where I am now.</p>
