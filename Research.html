        <p>There is numerous ways of research tools and techniques that can be used for creation of video games. You have your primary research which includes data collection from different sources you and A game developer may conducting playtests to observe how players interact with a new game mechanic and how it is performing. The feedback and data gathered will help improve the game before its release, which will help you improve. You have secondary research, which includes being collected by someone else in witch will provide information and finding out information from conducting surveys as such, Qualitative research is where you will look at it as a non-numerical data point of view were you will analyze it through non-numerical data, Quantitative Research, is where you look at it as a numerical data point of view  Quantitative research is also mostly used to standardize data collection and generalizing better informative findings.   </p>
        <p>Researching games is essential for making successful 2D games because it helps developers understand what works and what doesnt in game design. By studying popular and well-made 2D games, you can gain insights into gameplay mechanics, storytelling, art styles, and player engagement strategies. These insights are crucial in creating a game that not only functions well but also captures the interest of players.</p>
        <p>One major benefit of researching games is learning how to structure gameplay mechanics. Many successful 2D games, like Celeste or Hollow Knight, have perfected their control systems, making sure that the players actions feel smooth and responsive. Understanding how these mechanics are implemented can guide developers in designing fluid controls that enhance the players experience. Additionally, research helps identify common pitfalls, such as frustrating difficulty spikes or confusing user interfaces, so developers can avoid them in their own games. </p>
        <p>Researching other games also provides inspiration for art direction and level design. Whether its the pixel art of classic platformers or the hand drawn aesthetics of modern indie games, looking at a variety of styles can spark creativity and help you decide on a visual approach that suits your game. You can also analyze how different games use visual storytelling to create immersive worlds without relying heavily on dialogue or text. </p>
        <p>Lastly, player feedback from existing games offers valuable lessons. By reading reviews and forums, developers can understand what players love or dislike in certain games. This knowledge can help you anticipate player expectations and design features that resonate with your target audience.  </p>
        <p>In conclusion, researching games is a critical part of developing 2D games because it equips you with knowledge about what makes a game enjoyable, visually appealing, and engaging for players. This also allows you to know what audio fits what genre of game that you are making.  </p>
        <p> Qualitive research is something to do with collecting and analyzing data to understand people's behavior and beliefs, it's mostly often used in healthcare and education. Questions people do usually ask are things such as How and Why which are called open ended questions. These questions can be quite hard, there are also other types of things they do such as Naturalistic which can be things to do with research studies phenomena in their natural way. Another way qualitive research can be termed by is multiple systems of inquiry meaning they can use variety of methods of historical analysis and also case studies.  </p>
        <p>Quantitative research is a strategy that uses numbers and an objective stance to collect and analyze data. This shows us that it's used to generate knowledge and to make people understand about the social world, and can be associated with the natural, applied, formal and social sciences. Another thing quantitative research does is that it can be counted or compared on a numeric scale, often to address what or how many aspects of a research question. </p>
        <p> When creating a 2D game, both quantitative and qualitative research are essential, but they each provide different types of information that help in different ways. Quantitative research focuses on collecting numerical data that can be measured and analyzed. During the game development phase, this involves tracking how long players spend on a particular level, how many players complete certain objectives, or what percentage of players quit the game at certain points. These numbers help developers know the patterns and problems within the game's structure. For example, if many players are getting stuck at a certain level, the data will show that the level is too difficult, and adjustments must be needed to make it more balanced. Quantitative research helps to make the game more playable, ensuring that mechanics and challenges are fun and completable for the player.  Although qualitative research looks at the player's personal experiences and opinions about the game. This type of research involves interviews, focus groups, or open-ended questions where players explain what they liked, what frustrated them, and how the game made them feel overall. For a 2D game, the art style, music, and storyline are often key features, qualitative insights are always valuable because they provide a deeper understanding of how players connect with the game. For example, players might talk about how a particular character design made them feel towards the story or how the atmosphere of a level affected their enjoyment and playability. While quantitative data shows the facts, qualitative research uses the human perspective, showing how the game affects players on a personal level. Both types of research are necessary because quantitative data ensures the game functions well, while qualitative feedback helps make the game memorable and engaging for players. </p>
        <p> Primary research is a research method that relies on direct data collection, rather than relying on data thats already been collected by someone else. In other words, primary research is any type of research that you undertake yourself, firsthand, while using data that has already been collected is called secondary research. </p>
        <p> Secondary research is a research method that uses data that was collected by someone else. In other words, whenever you conduct research using data that already exists, you are conducting secondary research. </p>
        <p> When creating a 2D game, its important to gather information, you can do this through primary and secondary research. Primary research is when you collect information yourself. For example, if you want to know what players like in a game, you can ask them directly. You can also create a survey or interview players to learn about their favorite games, characters, or features. Another way you can do primary research is by watching people while they play games made by other companies. You should watch how they interact with the game, how and what makes them excited, or what frustrates them. You can even make a simple version of your game and invite your friends to play your game. By watching them play, you can see what they enjoy or find difficult. This feedback is valuable because it comes directly from the people who play and test your game. </p>
        <p> On the other hand, secondary research involves using information that someone else has already made. This can be articles, books, websites, or videos about game design and player preferences. For example, you can read articles about popular 2D games to understand how and what makes them successful. You could also watch YouTube videos that teach you about game development or read reviews of other games to see what players liked or didnâ€™t like. Secondary research is usually quicker than primary research because you dont have to collect the data yourself. </p>
        <p>Both primary and secondary research are important for creating a successful 2D game. Primary research gives you fresh ideas and direct feedback from players, while secondary research helps you learn from the experiences of others. By combining both types of research, you can create a 2d game that people will enjoy and will keep playing and share with their friends. </p>
